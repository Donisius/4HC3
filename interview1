Is it working? 

00:00:08 Speaker 2 

Yeah, yeah, I think it's recording now. 

00:00:10 Speaker 1 

Yeah perfect OK. 

00:00:12 Speaker 2 

Let's just get started. 

00:00:13 Speaker 2 

So just to give like just a. 

00:00:16 Speaker 2 

Little bit of a background I'm. 

00:00:18 Speaker 2 

Doing a project where. 

00:00:19 Speaker 2 

The theme is safety on campus. 

00:00:21 Speaker 2 

For one of my courses. 

00:00:23 Speaker 2 

Uhm, so I had some. 

00:00:24 Speaker 2 

Questions which pertain to some of the ideas that our group has. 

00:00:30 Speaker 2 

So yeah, I like on messenger. 

00:00:32 Speaker 2 

I gave you a little bit of an introduction to what our idea was before this interview. 

00:00:38 Speaker 2 

Yeah, which is an app which allows students to report hazards or obstructions and. 

00:00:43 Speaker 2 

Like kind of. 

00:00:44 Speaker 2 

Have those reports be displayed to other users in like a map? 

00:00:48 Speaker 2 

So are you familiar with Waze at all? 

00:00:51 Speaker 1 

No, I'm not. 

00:00:53 Speaker 2 

So it's kind of like a like a GPS app where, like other users can report incidents like Rd accidents or police like police patrolling nearby, and then other people that are nearby near that area that are also using Waze can see those reports as well as like points. 

00:01:11 

OK. 

00:01:13 Speaker 2 

On the map. 

00:01:14 Speaker 1 

That makes sense. 

00:01:15 Speaker 2 

Yeah, so we kind of want to do something like that, but instead of like a GPS app like in general like it would be like on campus where people can report incidents. 

00:01:27 Speaker 2 

Yeah so, and we also want to have those reports be like sent to relevant authorities like maintenance or security on campus. 

00:01:35 Speaker 1 

OK, that makes sense. 

00:01:38 Speaker 2 

So in that context, like. 

00:01:40 Speaker 2 

We wanted to know if, like you've got any experience, like any hazards on campus at all, like this can be anything like due to weather or. 

00:01:48 Speaker 2 

Or like insufficient lighting like stuff like that. 

00:01:51 Speaker 1 

Yeah, OK, I'd say it would you would you classify like crowded spaces or crowding as as a hazard or a potential hazard? 

00:02:00 Speaker 1 

Just because I know that the student center oftentimes fills up with so many students that the doors actually like get blocked and people get stuck in there for a couple minutes at times. 

00:02:09 Speaker 1 

So I'm wondering if that would be a. 

00:02:12 Speaker 1 

A hazard or a possible one. 

00:02:14 Speaker 2 

Yeah, for sure that could be like a potential hazard. 

00:02:17 Speaker 2 

Like, definitely like I. 

00:02:17 Speaker 2 

Thinking mostly in in the. 

00:02:21 Speaker 2 

Context of like. 

00:02:23 Speaker 2 

Social distancing or in the context of like people can potentially get trampled over like what happened at a concert. 

00:02:30 Speaker 1 

I would say I would say more like a potentially more like a fire hazard. 

00:02:35 Speaker 1 

Just like people can't even get in and out, but definitely there's a social distancing aspect as like we open up and and more people are on campus I I expect because they haven't changed the door situation at all in the. 

00:02:45 Speaker 1 

Students there so. 

00:02:47 Speaker 1 

I feel like if anything it'll be worse. 

00:02:48 Speaker 1 

1st so I think that's that would be useful to kind of know like peak times when like there's lots of people going in and out of a of a certain building potentially, and like what entrances are are kind of blocked off 'cause it can honestly affect if you make it to class on time or not. 

00:03:03 Speaker 1 

And things like. 

00:03:04 Speaker 1 

That, and I I've definitely experienced like I don't know. 

00:03:07 Speaker 1 

There's been bombing on the floor. 

00:03:09 Speaker 1 

Before and you know you want to obviously avoid stuff. 

00:03:11 Speaker 1 

Like that too or? 

00:03:13 Speaker 1 

Like a slippery floor would be good to to let maintenance know that there's a. 

00:03:18 Speaker 1 

You know a slip slipping hazard potentially there, like on the staircases before, so yeah. 

00:03:24 Speaker 2 

So I guess like a question that kind of comes from that is like would you take the time out of your day to like take out an app and report that to maintenance staff? 

00:03:33 Speaker 2 

If like you did witness like vomit on the floor or like a slipping hazard. 

00:03:38 Speaker 1 

Yeah, I think I would. 

00:03:40 Speaker 1 

I think it would be good though that I wouldn't want to have to type it all out if there was something like it was just like click, click and select kind of thing like oh I'm in the student center and there's a like a slip and fall hazard. 

00:03:53 Speaker 1 

I could just like, that's already prepopulated kind of and I'm just like clicking potential options. 

00:03:59 Speaker 2 

So like kind of like you it it. 

00:04:02 Speaker 2 

Finds the position you are in campus and then like you. 

00:04:06 Speaker 2 

Like it just lets you report an incident in your location that it found. 

00:04:11 Speaker 1 

Yeah, exactly exactly I would. 

00:04:13 Speaker 1 

I would like that and then I would like it so that I don't have to type it all out. 

00:04:17 Speaker 1 

I can just like there's I don't know. 

00:04:18 Speaker 1 

Let's say there's like 20 options and I I pick one of the 20 and that pertain to the incident that I'm witnessing or or I want to report. 

00:04:28 Speaker 2 

Yeah, that's perfect. 

00:04:29 Speaker 2 

That would be pretty useful. 

00:04:31 Speaker 1 

Yeah, no, I I think it would. 

00:04:33 Speaker 1 

Be useful for sure. 

00:04:34 Speaker 2 

OK, and for the like going back to the crowded areas kind of thing like. 

00:04:41 Speaker 2 

Besides, like reporting that I guess like for other users like do you think there are any? 

00:04:48 Speaker 2 

There's anything that authorities that McMaster could do to kind of stop that maybe? 

00:04:53 Speaker 1 

Yeah, I think that's a good point and I think gathering data would probably be the start of this. 

00:04:57 Speaker 1 

And and if there's consistently times every single day, five days a week where there's crowding, I think that McMaster, with the data that this app would generate would be you could you could actually talk to McMaster and go like we need to change the door situation. 

00:05:12 Speaker 1 

There needs to be. 

00:05:13 Speaker 1 

Multiple entrances or they need to change the style of the door that's used. 

00:05:17 Speaker 1 

Is that the crowding is too much and we have the data to prove that. 

00:05:21 Speaker 1 

So I think you could definitely do that. 

00:05:23 Speaker 1 

Maybe not within like the first week, but if you get I don't know a month or two of data you could probably talk to the appropriate authorities and show hey, like this is an issue and go from there. 

00:05:34 Speaker 2 

Yeah, I wasn't even thinking of that. 

00:05:36 Speaker 2 

But that's a really good idea. 

00:05:37 Speaker 2 

Like to kind of Crowdsource the the data gathering. 

00:05:41 Speaker 1 

Yeah, exactly exactly OK cool. 

00:05:44 Speaker 2 

Uhm, alright, I think that's it. 

00:05:45 Speaker 2 

I don't want to take up too much of your time. 

00:05:47 Speaker 2 

That was very useful. 

00:05:49 Speaker 2 

Thank you so much. 

00:05:50 Speaker 1 

Yeah, no problem. 

00:05:51 Speaker 1 

If you have any other questions let me know. 

00:05:54 Speaker 2 

Alright, sounds good. 

00:05:55 Speaker 2 

I'm going to stop. 

00:05:55 Speaker 2 

The recording now. 

00:05:56 Speaker 1 

OK, perfect.
